This repo is following the pattern of the [go-learning-projects](https://github.com/lethain/go-learning-projects) repo,
but instead with a focus on learning projects for Ruby.

It should be said that these are projects which I am using to learn Ruby,
and in no way are the reference implementations meant to represent high-quality Ruby!



Projects:

1. [spreadsheet](./spreadsheet/) - implement a simple class which represents a Spreadsheet,
    including both overriding the `[]` and `[]=` methods for easy access,
    and supporting formulas.
2. more to come...
